**1.4 Python setup — done**
- `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies; virtual environment in `.venv/`; package layout under `src/adrd_review/`.
- Installed: LangGraph 1.2.12, langchain-core 1.6.6, langchain-anthropic 1.7.5, langchain-google-genai 4.4.0, langchain-openai 1.6.6, pydantic 2.13.5, pandas 3.0.6, scikit-learn 1.9.1, statsmodels 0.15.0 (Python 3.14.7).
- `.env.example` added; keys will be filled in when available.
- Checked: a small LangGraph graph sent one article to 3 reviewers in parallel, collected 3 votes and detected agreement.

**2.2 PubMed tool — done** (see [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md))
- `src/adrd_review/tools/pubmed.py`: `fetch`, `search`, `lookup` (command line and Python).
- `src/adrd_review/schemas.py`: the `Article` record every agent will read.
- Checked:
  - 15 tests pass (14 offline + 1 live PubMed test).
  - Real run: a search for dementia + screening + MoCA (2024–2025) found 159 articles; 5 downloaded with complete fields; a second run read all 5 from cache; a DOI lookup returned the correct PMID.
- Waiting on: the professor's list of 268 PMIDs to run it on the real corpus.

**Still open from Day 1**
- 1.1 / 1.2 Request the gold-standard file (PMIDs + human labels), codebook, old system outputs, and the PubMed query + date used by the human team.
- 1.3 API keys.
